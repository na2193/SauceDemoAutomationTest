This class has common function that you can add that can be used
in any of the pages classes. We use common function so that we 
don't need to re-create code.

pageObjects package
Here are all the classes to store xpaths for each page

pages package
Here are all the pages on the web application where the xpaths are
stored and what actions to perform

Here are all the actual tests that are run, it calls the pages class
and runs the scripts

When testing/adding new pages:
1. Create new pageObjects java class for all xpaths
2. Create new pages java class 
3. Under src/test/java/tescases, create new testng class
4. Update testng.xml to run specifc tests
